## Today

* HW3 (database, Shiny)

    * [`deathtime`](https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/core/admissions/#admittime-dischtime-deathtime) vs [`dod`](https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/core/patients/#dod).
    
    * No need for intermediate `.rds` files.
    
    * Hint: When I knitted my work on HW3 on the teaching server, it never uses more than 1% of memory (320MB). If you find yourself using a lot more resource, you must have done something wrong. Keep the mindset: **Transform in database, plot in R**.

* Database (cont'd)
