## Today

* HW3 (database, Shiny).

    * [`deathtime`](https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/core/admissions/#admittime-dischtime-deathtime) vs [`dod`](https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/core/patients/#dod).
    
    * No need for intermediate `.rds` files.
    
    * Hint: When I knitted my work on HW3 on the teaching server, it uses <1 minute and never uses more than 1% of memory (320MB). If you find yourself using a lot more resource, you must have done something wrong. Keep the mindset: **Transform in database, plot in R**.  
    
    * You can work either on the teaching server or on your own computer, because we only need to access the BigQuery database in cloud.

* Database (cont'd).

* Cloud computing using GCP.
