## Announcements

* Today's office hours: 8pm-9pm.

* Yi Fang's solution to Tomoki's question: "how to replace the second vowel?"
```r
x <- c("apple", "pear", "banana")
y <- x %>%
  str_extract("([aeiou].*?[aeiou])") %>%
  str_replace(".$", "-")
str_replace(x, "([aeiou].*?[aeiou])", y)
```
Alternatively we can use group backreference
```r
x <- c("apple", "pear", "banana", "nut")
str_replace(x, "([aeiou])(.*?)([aeiou])", "\\1\\2-")
```
