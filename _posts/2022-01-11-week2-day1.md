## Today

* Linux basics (cont'd).

* Lab: establish SSH key connection between local machine (Mac), teaching server, and GitHub. Mitchell will help troubleshooting for Windows users.

* Homework 1 is posted. Due Jan 21st @ 11:59pm. Steps to get started:  
  1. Establish SSH key connection between local machine (your laptop or desktop) and teaching server.  
  2. Establish GitHub account and upload public key to GitHub. This will enable SSH key connection between local machine/teaching server and GitHub.  
  3. Create a private repository `biostat-203b-2022-winter` and add `Hua-Zhou` and `maschepps` as your collaborators with write permission.  
  4. Git clone to the teaching server, create the `develop` branch, and start working on it.

* Homework 1, Q2.

  - Complete CITI (Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative) Training <https://physionet.org/about/citi-course/>. Choose `Log in using my institution`. Once log in, choose `Affiliate With Another Institution` -> `Massachusetts Institute of Technology Affiliates`. It’s fine to put in any “affiliate email”. The course title is `Data or Specimens Only Research`.

    If you have completed similar modules for other training, submit certificate or screenshots. Still need to complete other CITI modules, which you have not taken before.

  - PhysioNet credential application. Input me as the “supervisor”.
  
* FYI: IDRE workshops
