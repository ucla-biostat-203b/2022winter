## Today

* This Thursday's (2/24) lab will be on Zoom. Mitchell will hold Q&A session on homework 3. You can send questions beforehand so he can be better prepared. 

* HW3 (database, Shiny).

    * "Pass through" capability of `dbplyr`. 
    
    * `collect` before saving the local `rds` file. 
    
    * Error message: `Invalid field name "50893". Fields must contain only letters, numbers, and underscores, start with a letter or underscore, and be at most 300 characters long. [invalid]`. BigQuery doesn't like field/variable/column name starting with a number. Check the `names_prefix` argument of the `pivot_wider` function.
