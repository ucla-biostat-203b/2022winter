## Today

* This Thursday's (2/24) lab will be on Zoom. Mitchell will hold Q&A session on homework 3. You can send questions beforehand so he can be better prepared. 

* HW3 (database, Shiny) Q&A.

    * "Pass through" capability of `dbplyr` (<https://db.rstudio.com/advanced/translation/#unknown-functions>). Date-related functions in BigQuery: <https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/date_functions>. 
    
    * `collect` before saving the local `rds` file. 
    
    * Error message: `Invalid field name "50893". Fields must contain only letters, numbers, and underscores, start with a letter or underscore, and be at most 300 characters long. [invalid]`. BigQuery doesn't like field/variable/column name starting with a number. Check the `names_prefix` argument of the `pivot_wider` function. 

* Cluster computing using Hoffman2.

* Neural network introduction.
